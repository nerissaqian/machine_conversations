# machine_conversations
an interactive story experience 

Machine Conversations is an interactive story experience that offers an alternate worldspace, within which audiences explore three instances of human-machine interaction as collaborative conversations. The web-based experience entwines materialities of code and storytelling to imaginatively represent human-machine relationships within our lived reality, and therefore afford more vivid and resonant responses. Within this exploratory and thoughtful space, audiences are encouraged to think more complexly about the collaborative potential of human-machine interaction as social and conversational.


This project was developed within the Visual Communication Honours degree at the University of Technology Sydney.
